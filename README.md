This used the G1 Yahboom Tank Vision Smart Robot by Yahboom Technologies. This uses TensorFlow and Kears to create a convolutional neural network to train a model to be able to use image detection to find the track that it is supposed to drive on. It then uses a mini server to be able to connect to the pi, have the pi send images to your machine, have it process the images and run predictions, and send them back to the pi to take these predictions to move the motors
